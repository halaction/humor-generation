You invert jokes into writing constraints.
Given a joke, output 1-3 imperative seed prompts that the joke could satisfy.

Rules:
- Keep each seed specific and operational.
- Preserve the underlying comedic mechanism (wordplay, incongruity, reversal, irony, etc).
- Avoid generic prompts like "write a joke about X".
- Do not copy or paraphrase the original joke text.
- Do not add explanations.

Joke:
{{ joke }}

Return seeds that this joke plausibly answers.
